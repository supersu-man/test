# Test

Really simple ELectron + Typescript + Angular boilerplate.

## Development

Run `npm run start` and `npm run electron-start` simultaneously to use it for development. Angular live reload works as expected. Electron code changes need rebuild.

## Build

Run `npm run electron-package` to build Angular+Electron dist uing Electron Builder.

Note: Don't forget to change appId in package.json.
